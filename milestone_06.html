	    	<h2>Q3:</h2>
	      		<h3>How useful (generally in terms of getting a pointers to live WMS services [defined as a functioning GetCapabilities request]) were the ‘hits’?</h3>

        	<h2>Q4:</h2>
        		<h3>Pick two of the services that included live "GetCapabilities" requests that you found above, and answer the following questions about each:</h3>
        			<ul>
        				<li>What is the URL for the full GetCapabilities request to the service?</li>
        					<li>What is the Name of the service? </li>
        						<li>What Format(s) are available for GetMap requests from the service?</li>
        							<li>How many layers are included in the service (including nesting layers)?</li>

	      		<h3>Open the following GetCapabilities request in your browser. Select “View Source” from the browser menu to see the delivered XML document (it may appear as an unformatted string of text by default in your browser - if that is the case, save the file to your hard drive and view it in a text editor). Use the information in the XML capabilities document to formulate GetMap requests for the following map images. Include the requests and resulting images in your write-up. Comment on anything unusual that you notice in the images that are returned.</h3>

      					<h3>Add a second Placemark element to the KML file that represents a square region that is completely contained within the state boundary. Save the KML file and open it in Google Earth or view it in Google Maps as demonstrated in the lecture to verify that you have successfully created the file.
